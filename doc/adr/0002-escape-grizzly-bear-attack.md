## Context

While sitting around our campfire, we see a grizzly bear. He comes closer sniffing the air. When he sees us he begins to charge.

## Decision

We will yell loudly, bang pots and pans together, and pepper spray the bear in the face.

## Consequences

We believe that the noise combined with the pepper spray will scare away the bear. This will help us avoid an untimely demise. However, the bear may not respond to the pepper spray and in that event we will scatter and run for our lives.
