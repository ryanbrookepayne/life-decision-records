Date: 2020-07-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

It is 10:06pm on a hot and muggy summer evening. There are three flavors of ice cream in our refrigerator‚Äîvanilla, chocolate, and sherbet.

## Decision

We will consume the entire carton of sherbet in one sitting.

## Consequences

Our stomachs will be so full of sherbet that we will not be able to eat any vanilla or chocolate ice cream. But who cares?!? We will have gleefully enjoyed the sweet fruity flavor of sherbet ice cream!
