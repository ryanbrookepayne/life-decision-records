# 3. 🐩 Find Lost Dog

Date: 2020-06-23

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We have not seen our dog Pickles—a small white poodle—for 10 days, 5 hours, and 20 minutes.

## Decision

We will post a reward around the neighborhood offering $1,000 for finding and safetly returning Pickles into our care.

## Consequences

We believe that a kind hearted samaritan will find Pickles—if he is still alive—and return him safely to our humble abode. However, an enterprising individual may take advantage of the opportunity and upon finding Pickle's hold him hostage for a higher reward rate.
