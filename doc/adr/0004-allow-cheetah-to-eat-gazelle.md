# 4. ðŸ™€ Allow Cheetah to Eat Gazelle

Date: 2020-06-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We are on a Safari in a wildlife preserve in Africa. From the comfort of our 4x4 Land Rover, we see a cheetah chase down a gazelle. The cheetah is about to begin feasting on the Gazelleâ€”which is still alive.

## Decision

We will do nothing and continue watching in horror from the comfort and safety of our air conditioned vehicle.

## Consequences

The gazelle will die a painful death and be eaten by the cheetah. But the wildlife preserve we are visiting will continue to thrive because the natural order of life has not been disrupted.
